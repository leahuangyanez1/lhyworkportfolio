            Hi my name is Lea Huang-Yanez. I am a student studying sustainable design- a major that combines architecture, 
            landscape architecture, urban planning, and sustainability; while minoring in computer science.  Iâ€™m interested
             in working with world building and speculation, using graphics and illustrations of architecture and web aesthetics
              to explore sustainability and technology with my art-design work.

        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am building a <a href="spw.html">solar powered website</a> that will catalog featured books from the sustainability collection 
            at the Ricker Library of Art & Design. I initated this project and am completing it as part of an independent study, 
            so I am designing, programming, and building a physical server for the website. My goal is to address excessive energy 
            use online and provide an alternate solution for a digital object that creates minimal impact.
        </p>
        <p>
            A big past project of mine was a collection of text and imagery created as part of a <a href="sw.html">speculative world</a> I built. In this 
            world, I contrasted artifical intelligence with nature to comment on the overuse of technology. I started building this 
            world through illustration, but it evolved into a mesh of photos, videos, texts, and graphics. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently taking the second introductory design studio for architecture and a sustainable design studio. <a href="studio.html">Here</a> is the 
            work I produced from those classes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have a collection of one-off personal work. This is my <a href="steamp.html">study on steampunk</a> depicted through text and imagery. This is 
            an <a href="paper.html">exploration of graphite and thread on paper</a>. <a href="drawing.html">These</a> are my favorite digital illustrations. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While my modes of expression are diverse, one correlation between all my big projects are that they are research driven.
             I want to create projects that inspire people to fight for a more sustainable world.
