            <h3>As we slowly recover from the devastating pandemic caused by a computational parasite known as ‘Artificially I
            ntelligent Biomimicry,’ it is important that we stay mindful of the mistakes that led us to sharing this fate. 
                Artificially Intelligent Biomimicry, also referred to as AIBM-3092 for short, were glitches that occurred when AI
                 models employed for, or near, biologically living organisms internalized the information it received from its 
                 environment, and started behaving as if it was a biological entity itself. As we shifted towards a technology 
                 centered society, AI systems were further integrated into fundamental parts of our lives, giving machines exposure 
                 to information that we could never fathom having or understanding. As researchers across disciplines scrutinize this
                  event, it becomes apparent that our over-reliance and trust in technology made this pandemic inevitable. As we 
                  rebuild from what is left of our community and the earth, we have to ask ourselves: How much of our lives should AI 
                  and technology control? Where do we set the boundary? </h3>
